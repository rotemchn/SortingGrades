This is a project of sorting data with 2 dimensions.
Sorting this data is complicated when having incomparable elements.
We used random data, and real data of applicants applying to Ben-Gurion University (in the "Real Students Grades.csv").
One dimension is a student's SAT score, and the other is a student's high-school GPA.
We checked several sorting algorithms, created plots of our findings.
